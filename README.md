## üí• Introduction

DevDost (formerly GitDost) is a standalone voice assistant to perform routine tasks around development and most importantly it help you eliminate mundane git commands.

## üí° Why did I build this?

Let me ask you one question , which is correct `git origin push main` , `git push origin main` or `git push main origin` ? You may know the answer, but someone new to git may find it difficult. As a result,it all started with "GitDost" to help beginners get started with version control and allows them to avoid using drive links to share their code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development

That's pretty easy. To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, we would recommend you to have <b>Git</b>, <b>Python or Annaconda</b> and <b>pip</b> installed.

We will first start with setting up the Local Project Environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tejas-Ladhani/DevDost.git
cd DevDost
pip install -r requirements.txt
python devDost.py
```
